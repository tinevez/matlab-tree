%% Introduction

%% What is a tree data structure?
%
% I guess that if you are reading this, you probably know more than me. A
% tree is a hierarchical data structure where, where the data are organized
% in nodes, that can have 0 or several children nodes. The topmost node is
% called the root of the tree, and has no parent and no siblings. The
% "bottom" nodes, that have no children, are called the leaves. 
% 
% Contrary to real trees, it is common to represent data trees with the
% root at the top, like this:
% 
%              EMS              
%     +REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-+REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH+

%             |    |    |    |  
%            Eal  Ear  Epl  Epr 
%
% Here, |EMS| is the tree root, it has two children named |MS| and |E|, and
% the nodes named |MSa|, |MSp|, |Eal|, |Ear|, |Epl| and |Epr| are the
% leaves. 
% 
% A bit of off-topic culture: The example depicted here is a subset of a
% _C.elegans_ embryo cell lineage. _C.elegans_ are small worms that are
% used a lot in Biology. Some research is made following a _C.elegans_
% embryo from the very first cell in the egg. It divides in two, each
% daughter subsequently divide in two, and so on. It turns out that for
% _C.elegans_, the dividing scheme and the cell fate is totally
% reproducible and predictable in healthy embryo, a rare feature amongst
% living species. Each cell has therefore a standardized name, and the
% above tree is a part of the lineage.
%
% A tree is typically a good structure to hold any measure made on each
% cell. You can store a value in such a tree, and be able to compare it to
% the children, the siblings or parent value. A linear array does not offer
% this structure, and is more suited for instance to time series.
%
% Note that another data structure would actually be more suited for this
% specific example: Since each cell has always exactly two daughter, a
% *binary tree* would be a better. A binary tree is a more specialized kind
% of tree, where each node has exactly two children, and their order is
% determined by their identity, which can be  _left_ or _right_. This tree
% class is a generic tree, where each node can have any number of children.
% The siblings order is not specific, and simply correspond to the addition
% order.
%
% We will use anyway the _C.elegans_ lineage data as an example. The |tree|
% class ships with examples that include a partial _C.elegans_ lineage from

%% Basic information on a tree
%
% A tree object has simply two members:

%%
% |Parent| is an integer array that stores the parent of the node at this

% are between gentlemen, so you can read and even modify these fields at

% make it easier to manipulate the tree.
%
% The *|nnodes|* method returns the total number of nodes in a tree:

% And the *|tostring|* method we have seen above generates a nice |char|
